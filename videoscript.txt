Check out this funky trick:
Embrace the power of display grid,
Say goodbye to Bootstrap's bullshit.
We're going modern, my man,
With layouts that won't drive you insane.
see hiow sick this is,
Just add a property called "grid," to a div for example.  you see,
And watch the magic happen effortlessly.
Define your grid columns and rows,
In different units, the choice is yours to pose.
Can you feel the awesomeness in the air?
Grid layouts have never been so fair.
So go ahead, give it a try,
And let your designs reach for the sky.
You got this, my creative mate,
